Dear Prof. Williams,
I am extremely honored to accept your invitation of giving a presentation to a host of
foreign students on Chinese culture.
Here are the key points of my presentation. First of all, compared with Westerners, the
Chinese people paid more attention to the harmonious relation between human beings and
nature. “Nature and Man are one” is a familiar statement in traditional Chinese ideology. In
addition, much emphasis is laid upon the moral cultivation and temper refinement as well as
the spiritual enlightenment on the part of individual rather than upon the logic reasoning.
My appreciation to you for your generous help is beyond words. I am looking forward to
hearing from you soon.
Yours sincerely,
Li Ming
